- The default Elastic Maps Service version is now `7.7`.

### Added
- The `appName` parameter can now be configured to specify the client application. Previously, the client application was hard-coded to `kibana`.
- The `appVersion` configurable parameter replaces the `kbnVersion` parameter for specifying the client application version, e.g. `7.7.0`.

### Deprecated
- The `kbnVersion` parameter has been deprecated and the `appVersion` parameter should be used instead.

### Fixed
- Correctly handle API urls that end in slashes

## [7.6.0] - 2020-01-13

### Added
- Two new parameters were introduced, `tileApiUrl` and `fileApiUrl`. These should be used instead of `manifestServiceUrl`. These parameters should be set to their respective domains (e.g. `https://tiles.maps.elastic.co`, `https://vector.maps.elastic.co`). [#13](https://github.com/elastic/ems-client/pull/13)

### Changed

- Starting with v7.6, new Elastic Maps Service (EMS) versions will be released with every matching major and minor release of the Elastic Stack. New releases of ems-client will also be released to match the EMS versions.

- Handle relative URLs in EMS v7.6 manifests.

### Deprecated
- `manifestServiceUrl` is now deprecated as the catalogue manifest has been removed in Elastic Maps Service (EMS) v7.6. It has been replaced by two new parameters `tileApiUrl` and `fileApiUrl`.
